% *****************
%  Requirements:
% *****************
%
% - All pages sized consistently at 8.5 x 11 inches (US letter size).
% - PDF length <= 8 pages for full papers, <=2 pages for extended
%    abstracts.
% - Abstract length <= 250 words.
% - No visible crop marks.
% - Images at no greater than 300 dpi, scaled at 100%.
% - Embedded open type fonts only.
% - All layers flattened.
% - No attachments.
% - All desired links active in the files.

% Note that the PDF file must not exceed 5 MB if it is to be indexed
% by Google Scholar. Additional information about Google Scholar
% can be found here:
% http://www.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html.


% If your system does not generate letter format documents by default,
% you can use the following workflow:
% latex example
% bibtex example
% latex example ; latex example
% dvips -o example.ps -t letterSize example.dvi
% ps2pdf example.ps example.pdf


% For pdflatex users:
% The alifeconf style file loads the "graphicx" package, and
% this may lead some users of pdflatex to experience problems.
% These can be fixed by editing the alifeconf.sty file to specify:
% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
%   instead of
% \usepackage{graphicx}.
% The PDF output generated by pdflatex should match the required
% specifications and obviously the dvips and ps2pdf steps become
% unnecessary.


% Note:  Some laser printers have a serious problem printing TeX
% output. The use of ps type I fonts should avoid this problem.
